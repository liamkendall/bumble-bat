# Contents

This repository contains the required data and code to reproduce a global meta-analysis of diel pollination differences in flowering plants. 

Data (data folder) consist of diel pollination comparisons and metadata extracted directly from literature (DvN_LiteratureDataClean_2024-09-13.csv), study-site level environmental data (DvN_Site_DailyTemperatureRange.csv, DvN_Site_Daylength.csv and DvN_Sites_elevation.csv) and plant functional traits (SppTraitData_clean.csv).

Scripts (script folder) consist of data curation and cleaning steps (001 - 004), model fitting (005) and model reporting and visualisation (006). After each major step, .rData files are saved within the Output folder for use in later scripts.
